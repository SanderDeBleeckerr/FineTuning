Certain providers, including those that provide the listing or advertising of such services, should be explicitly excluded from the rule because they do not enter into direct competition with traditional, non-digital sectors.\n(3)\nTaxable persons who facilitate, through the use of an electronic interface such as a marketplace, platform, portal or similar means, the supply of short-term accommodation rental services or passenger transport services by road should not be held responsible for payment of any value added tax (VAT) due when they act on information provided by the underlying supplier, if those taxable persons can demonstrate that they could not reasonably have known that that information was incorrect.\n(4)\nFor the purpose of determining the place of supply of a facilitation service provided to a non-taxable person through the use of an electronic interface such as a marketplace, platform, portal or similar means, taxable persons should be able to easily identify the status of the recipient of the facilitation service. In order to facilitate such identification and to reduce the administrative burden on taxable persons, a taxable person should regard the recipient of the facilitation service as a taxable person where an identification number for VAT purposes is provided and as a non-taxable person where no such number is provided, unless that taxable person has information to the contrary.\n(5)\nIt should be clarified that, with regard to short-term accommodation rental services and passenger transport services by road, the special scheme for small enterprises provided for in Directive 2006/112/EC can apply only to the taxable person deemed to have supplied those services.\n(6)\nA one-stop shop (‘OSS’) simplification scheme for taxable persons making cross-border transfers of certain own goods was introduced into Directive 2006/112/EC by Council Directive (EU) 2025/516\n(\n2\n)\n. In order to implement that specific scheme in the overall framework of the VAT special schemes provided for in Title XII, Chapter 6, of Directive 2006/112/EC, specific rules pertaining to VAT identification, conditions for exclusion, VAT returns and record-keeping obligations should be set out in Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011\n(\n3\n)\n.\n(7)\nAs the OSS simplification scheme introduced is comprehensive and encompasses cross-border movements of goods covered by call-off stock arrangements, those arrangements have been removed from Directive 2006/112/EC. The implementing provisions pertaining to call-off stock arrangements are no longer required and should therefore be deleted from Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011.\n(8)\nUnder Article 242a of Directive 2006/112/EC, taxable persons who facilitate, through the use of an electronic interface such as a marketplace, platform, portal or similar means, the supply of goods or services to a non-taxable person within the Community in accordance with Title V of that Directive are obliged to keep records of those supplies. However, information is required only in respect of supplies of goods or services that are facilitated by the electronic interface and is not required in cases where the deemed-supplier rule applies. In order to support the fight against VAT fraud, such information relating to underlying suppliers should also be included in the mandatory set of information to be kept by deemed suppliers who are registered to use the special OSS simplification schemes. Those additional data elements should allow for a comparison of information reported by platforms with payment data on cross-border transactions available in the central electronic system of payment information established pursuant to Chapter V, Section 2, of Council Regulation (EU) No 904/2010\n(\n4\n)\n, which entered into force on 1 January 2024.\n(9)\nFollowing the introduction into Directive 2006/112/EC of an obligation for taxable persons transferring goods of another taxable person to inform the owner of the goods that their goods are being or will be transferred, it should be clarified which specific data are to be communicated to the owner of the goods.\n(10)\nThe elements of Directive 2006/112/EC which require amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 are to be transposed by Member States into national legislation by 30 June 2028. Therefore, it is necessary for the amendments to that Regulation to be applicable from 1 July 2028.\n(11)\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nImplementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nthe following articles are inserted:\n‘Article 9b\n1.   For the application of Article 28a of Directive 2006/112/EC, the term “facilitates” means the use by a taxable person of an electronic interface to allow a customer and a supplier offering supplies, within the Union, of short-term accommodation rental services or passenger transport services by road through the electronic interface to enter into contact, which results in a supply of such services through that electronic interface.\n2.   A taxable person shall not be considered to facilitate a supply of short-term accommodation rental services or passenger transport services by road where all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthat taxable person does not set, either directly or indirectly, any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made;\n(b)\nthat taxable person is not, either directly or indirectly, involved in authorising the charge to the customer in respect of the payments made;\n(c)\nthat taxable person is not, either directly or indirectly, involved in the provision of that supply.\n3.   Article 28a of Directive 2006/112/EC shall not apply to a taxable person who only provides one or more of the following:\n(a)\nthe processing of payments in relation to the supply of short-term accommodation rental services or passenger transport services by road;\n(b)\nthe listing or advertising of short-term accommodation rental services or passenger transport services by road;\n(c)\nthe redirecting or transferring of customers to other electronic interfaces where short-term accommodation rental services or passenger transport services by road are offered for sale, without any further intervention in the supply.\n4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, Article 28a of Directive 2006/112/EC shall not apply to a taxable person who provides the means by which the cost of passenger transport services by road can be shared between the user and the person providing the transport.\nArticle 9c\nFor the application of Article 28a(1) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the taxable person supplying the services shall provide their identification number for VAT purposes or the identification number allocated to them in accordance with Article 362 or 369d of that Directive, as referred to in Article 28a(1), point (a), of that Directive, and the declaration referred to in Article 28a(1), point (b), of that Directive to the taxable person facilitating the supply only once, unless there is a change in their activity as a taxable person.\nWhere a passenger transport service by road takes place in more than one Member State, the taxable person supplying the service shall provide to the taxable person facilitating the supply the identification number for VAT purposes allocated to them by each Member State in which the transport takes place, or the identification number allocated to them in accordance with Article 362 or 369d of Directive 2006/112/EC.\nArticle 9d\nFor the application of Article 28a of Directive 2006/112/EC, where, on the basis of information provided by the person supplying the underlying services, a taxable person does not act as the deemed supplier, that taxable person shall not be held liable for the payment of the VAT due where it is subsequently found that that taxable person should have been deemed to be the supplier, provided that all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthe taxable person is dependent on information provided by the supplier of the services;\n(b)\nthe information provided by the supplier of the services is erroneous;\n(c)\nthe taxable person can prove that they did not and could not reasonably have known that that information was erroneous.\nArticle 9e\nFor the purpose of determining the place of supply of a facilitation service as referred to in Article 46a of Directive 2006/112/EC, the taxable person shall regard the person to whom that service was supplied as a non-taxable person where that person to whom that service was supplied does not provide a VAT identification number, unless that taxable person has information to the contrary.\nArticle 9f\nThe exemptions laid down in Article 98(2), and Articles 371, 378, 379 to 386 and 388 to 390c of Directive 2006/112/EC shall still apply where the taxable person facilitating the supply of services is deemed to have received and supplied those services themselves under Article 28a of that Directive.\nArticle 9g\nWhere a taxable person is deemed to have received and supplied the services referred to in Article 28a of Directive 2006/112/EC themselves, the supply of those services may be subject to the special scheme provided for in Title XII, Chapter 1, of that Directive if that taxable person meets the conditions for that special scheme.\nThe supply of the services referred to in Article 28a of Directive 2006/112/EC provided to a taxable person who is deemed to have received and supplied those services themselves shall not be subject to the special scheme provided for in Title XII, Chapter 1, of that Directive.’\n;\n(2)\nin Article 13a, the introductory wording is replaced by the following:\n‘The place where a non-taxable legal person is established, as referred to in Article 54(1), second subparagraph, Article 56(2), first subparagraph, and Articles 58 and 59 of Directive 2006/112/EC, shall be:’\n;\n(3)\nin Article 18(2), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n‘However, irrespective of information to the contrary, the supplier of telecommunications, broadcasting or electronically supplied services, or of services under Article 54(1), second subparagraph, of Directive 2006/112/EC, may regard a customer established within the Community as a non-taxable person as long as that customer has not communicated their individual VAT identification number to the supplier of those services.’\n;\n(4)\nin Article 23, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n‘2.   Where, in accordance with Article 54(1), second subparagraph, and Articles 58 and 59 of Directive 2006/112/EC, a supply of services is taxable at the place where the customer is established, or, in the absence of an establishment, where the customer has their permanent address or usually resides, the supplier shall establish that place based on factual information provided by the customer, and verify that information by normal commercial security measures such as those relating to identity or payment checks.’\n;\n(5)\nin Article 24b, first paragraph, the introductory wording is replaced by the following:\n‘For the application of Article 54(1), second subparagraph, or Article 58 of Directive 2006/112/EC, where the activities are streamed or otherwise made virtually available to a non-taxable person, or where telecommunications, broadcasting or electronically supplied services are supplied to a non-taxable person:’\n;\n(6)\nin Article 24d, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.   Where a supplier supplies a service under Article 54(1), second subparagraph, of Directive 2006/112/EC, or a service listed in Article 58(1) of that Directive, the supplier may rebut a presumption referred to in Article 24a or Article 24b, first subparagraph, point (a), (b) or (c), of this Regulation on the basis of three items of non-contradictory evidence indicating that the customer is established, has their permanent address or usually resides elsewhere.’\n;\n(7)\nin Article 24f, the introductory wording is replaced by the following:\n‘For the purpose of applying the rules in Article 54(1), second subparagraph, or Article 58 of Directive 2006/112/EC and fulfilling the requirements of Article 24b, first subparagraph, point (d), or Article 24d(1) of this Regulation, the following shall, in particular, serve as evidence:’\n;\n(8)\nArticle 30 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 30\n1.   The supply of services of intermediaries as referred to in Article 46 of Directive 2006/112/EC shall cover the services of intermediaries acting in the name of and on behalf of the recipient of the services procured and the services performed by intermediaries acting in the name of and on behalf of the provider of the services procured.\n2.   For the purposes of Article 46a of Directive 2006/112/EC, the term “facilitation service” means a service supplied by a taxable person to either a customer or a supplier, or to both, through the use of an electronic interface such as a marketplace, platform, portal or similar means, thereby allowing the customer and the supplier to enter into contact which results in a supply of goods or services through that electronic interface.\nA facilitation service as referred to in the first subparagraph shall be regarded as distinct and independent from the goods or services that the taxable person is deemed to supply.\n3.   A taxable person shall not be considered to supply a facilitation service where all of the following conditions are met:\n(a)\nthat taxable person does not set, either directly or indirectly, any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made;\n(b)\nthat taxable person is not, either directly or indirectly, involved in authorising a charge to the customer in respect of the payment made;\n(c)\nthat taxable person is not, either directly or indirectly, involved in the provision of that supply.\n4.   Article 46a of Directive 2006/112/EC shall not apply to a taxable person who only provides one or more of the following:\n(a)\nthe processing of payments in relation to the supply;\n(b)\nthe listing or advertising

Article 369xb of Directive 2006/112/EC who is permitted to use the transfer-of-own-goods scheme;’\n;\n(14)\nin Article 57d, the following paragraph is added:\n‘3.   Where a taxable person informs the Member State of identification that they intend to make use of the transfer-of-own-goods scheme, that special scheme shall apply as from the first day of the following calendar month.\nHowever, where

the month following that first transfer.’\n;\n(15)\nin Article 57e, the following paragraph is added:\n‘The Member State of identification shall identify the taxable person using the

Cessation shall be effective as of the first day of the next calendar month.
