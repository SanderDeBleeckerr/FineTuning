It is a proxy for VAT revenues lost due to VAT fraud, evasion and avoidance, non-fraudulent bankruptcies and financial insolvencies, or miscalculations, among other drivers. The VAT compliance gap is also influenced by economic developments, one-off government support measures and the quality of national statistics. The VAT compliance gap in 2022 in the EU Member States is shown in the map below.\nThe VAT compliance gap is presented in % of the VAT Total Tax Liability (VTTL).\nDevelopment of VAT compliance gap (2018 vs 2022) in percentage points\nThe VAT compliance gap has decreased between 2018 and 2022 in most EU Member States. In the EU, the VAT compliance gap in 2022 amounted to 7.0% of the VAT Total Tax Liability (VTTL). Compared to 2018, the VAT compliance gap reduced by 4.2 percentage points. The development of the VAT compliance gap in EU Member States between 2018 and 2022 is shown in the map below.\nThe VAT compliance gap is presented in % of the VAT Total Tax Liability (VTTL).\nActionable VAT policy gap\nThe overall VAT policy gap is an estimate of the VAT revenues that are lost due to the application of reduced VAT rates and exemptions, compared to a single, standard statutory VAT rate. The\nactionable\nVAT policy gap refers to the portion of the VAT policy gap that can be influenced by Member States. Specifically, it relates to the foregone VAT revenues that can be attributed to reduced rates and exemptions that could potentially be discontinued or eliminated. The actionable VAT policy gaps in 2022 in the EU Member States are shown in the map below.\nThe actionable VAT policy gap is presented in % of the notional ideal VAT revenue.\nDetailed results per selected region\nYou can find the main results for all EU Member States and the European Union on this website.

With an EU VAT compliance gap of approximately 7.0%, Sweden ranked 13th among the EU Member States. Between 2018 and 2022 the VAT compliance gap increased from 2.5% to 5.5%. The development in between is displayed in the figure. The actionable VAT policy gap was 10.7% in 2022 – a slight decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared to 2021. Between 2018 and 2022, the actionable VAT policy gap decreased from 12.4% to 10.7%. For context: if no product or service was exempt from VAT and no reduced VAT rates were used, the actionable VAT policy gap would be 0%.\nDownload Sweden report\nBack to countries\nReports 2009 - 2024\nYear\nReport\n2024\nReport\n-\nExecutive Summary\n-\nInfographic\n-\nTables Report\n-\nGraphs Report\n-\nTables Country Chapter\n2023\nReport\n-\nExecutive Summary\n-\nInfographic\n-\nTables Report\n-\nGraphs Report\n-\nTables Country Chapter\n2022\nReport\n-\nExecutive Summary\n-\nTables Report\n-\nGraphs Report\n-\nTables Country Chapter\n2021\nVAT Gap in the EU – Report 2021\n2020\nStudy and reports on the VAT gap in the EU-28 Member States\n2019\nStudy and reports on the VAT gap in the EU-28 Member States\n2018\nStudy and reports on the VAT gap in the EU-28 Member States\n2017\nStudy and reports on the VAT gap in the EU-28 Member States\n2016\nStudy and reports on the VAT gap in the EU-28 Member States\n2015\nStudy to quantify and analyse the VAT gap in the EU Member States\n2014\n2012 update report to the study to quantify and analyse the VAT gap\n2013\nStudy to quantify and analyse the VAT gap in the EU-27 Member States\n2009\nStudy to quantify and analyse the VAT gap in the EU-25 Member States\nVAT compliance gap due to MTIC fraud\nMissing trader intra-Community fraud (MTIC fraud) is a prominent form of VAT non-compliance. This type of fraud exploits VAT-free trade of goods and services between EU Member States. Fraudsters acquire goods and services VAT-free from another Member State, supply them to other businesses and charge VAT, before disappearing without remitting the VAT to the tax authorities (hence the term ‘missing trader’). We refer to VAT revenues lost due to this type of fraud as the ‘MTIC gap’.\nThe European Commission concluded a project\nto develop a methodology for estimating the MTIC gap\n. The first phase of the project assessed various methodological approaches to identify the best framework for recurrently estimating VAT revenue lost to MTIC fraud. Two methodologies were identified for further testing: an\napproach based on Intrastat data\nand classification data mining techniques, and an\napproach leveraging VIES data\non intra-Community supplies and similar reporting obligations on intra-Community acquisitions. To gather data on intra-Community transactions, the Commission collaborates with Tax Administrations of EU Member States participating in the TADEUS project. Details on the processing and protection of individual-level data are provided in the privacy statement linked below. For more details on Phase I of the study, please download the\nfull report\nor the\nExecutive Summary\n.\nThe second phase of the project estimated the MTIC gap at EU level using Intrastat mirror-trade statistics. The results showed that the\nestimated annual MTIC gap ranged from €12.5 billion to €32.8 billion between 2010 and 2023\n. This represents an average annual VAT revenue loss of 1.2-3.1% of actual VAT revenue. Over the period, the MTIC gap increased slightly in nominal terms, driven by the growth of the tax base and trade volume. Despite this, the stability of the MTIC gap estimates over time suggests that factors other than MTIC fraud contribute to fluctuations in the VAT compliance gap.
