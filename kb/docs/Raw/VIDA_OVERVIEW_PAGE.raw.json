  "text": "VAT in the Digital Age\nProposal\nPage contents\nPage contents\nOn 8 December 2022, the European Commission proposed measures to modernise the EU’s Value-Added Tax (VAT) system, make it work better for businesses and more resilient to fraud, and address challenges in VAT raised by the development of the platform economy.\nLatest news\n28\nOct\n2025\nImplementation Dialogue\nOn Tuesday 28 October, Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra hosted a strategic dialogue on the VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) package.\n24\nSep\n2025\nImplementation Strategy\nThis implementation strategy sets out the actions that the Commission will deploy to support businesses and Member States with the implementation of the VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) package.\n11\nMar\n2025\nAdoption of the VAT in the Digital Age package\nThe VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) package has been adopted on 11 March 2025 following reconsultation of the European Parliament and will be rolled out progressively until January 2035.\nBackground\nAccording to the\n2023 VAT Gap Report\n, EU countries lost €99 billion in VAT revenues in 2020. Conservative estimates suggest that one-quarter of the missing revenues can be attributed directly to VAT fraud linked to intra-EU trade. In addition, VAT arrangements in the EU can still be burdensome for businesses, especially SMEs, scale-ups and companies operating cross-border.\nKey actions proposed under ViDA will help EU countries collect up to €18 billion more in VAT revenues annually (€11 billion as a result of anti-fraud measures) while helping businesses, including SMEs, to grow.\nReal-time digital reporting\nThe new system introduces real-time digital reporting for cross-border trade, based on e-invoicing. It will give Member States the valuable information they need to step up the fight against VAT fraud, especially carousel fraud.\nThe move to e-invoicing will help reduce VAT fraud by up to €11 billion a year and bring down administrative and compliance costs for EU traders by over €4.1 billion per year over the next ten years. It ensures that, in time, existing national systems converge across the EU and paves the way for EU countries that wish to introduce national digital reporting systems for domestic trade.\nUpdated rules for the platform economy\nUnder the new rules, platforms facilitating supplies in the passenger transport and short-term accommodation sectors will become responsible for collecting and remitting VAT to tax authorities when their users do not, for example because they are a small business or individual providers.\nTogether with other clarifications, this will ensure a uniform approach across all EU countries and contribute to a more level playing field between online and traditional short-term accommodation and transport services. It will also simplify life for SMEs who currently need to understand and comply with the VAT rules, often in different EU countries.\nSingle VAT registration\nBuilding on the already existing ‘VAT One Stop Shop’ (OSS) model for e-commerce, the proposals would allow more businesses selling to consumers in another EU country to fulfil their VAT obligations via an online portal in one EU country. Further measures to improve the collection of VAT include making the ‘Import One Stop Shop’ (IOSS) mandatory for certain platforms facilitating sales by persons established outside the EU to consumers in the EU.\nLegal Texts\nProposal for a directive\n8 December 2022\nProposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards VAT rules in the Digital Age\nProposal for a regulation\n8 December 2022\nProposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 as regards the VAT administrative cooperation arrangements needed for the digital age\nProposal for a regulation\n8 December 2022\nProposal for a Council implementing Regulation amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 as regards information requirements for certain VAT schemes\nSummary of impact assessment\n8 December 2022\nImpact Assessment – Executive Summary - VAT in the Digital Age\nImpact assessment\n8 December 2022\nImpact Assessment - VAT in the Digital Age\nFinal Report\nReport\n7 December 2022\nVAT in the Digital Age - Volume 1: Digital Reporting Requirements\nReport\n7 December 2022\nVAT in the Digital Age - Volume 2: VAT Treatment of the Platform Economy\nReport\n7 December 2022\nVAT in the Digital Age - Volume 3: Single Place of VAT Registration and Import One Stop Shop\nReport\n7 December 2022\nVAT in the Digital Age - Volume 4: Consultation Activities\nSummary\n7 December 2022\nVAT in the Digital Age - Final Report Executive Summary\nFactsheet\nFactsheet\n5 December 2022\nVAT in the digital age - Factsheet\nImplementation\nGeneral publications\n24 September 2025\nImplementation Strategy - VAT in the Digital Age\nRelated links\nVAT Gap Report\nPress release on the VAT in the Digital Age proposals\nQ&A MEMO on the VAT in the Digital Age proposals\nShare this page"
